👋 Hi, I’m @Khalid-Siddiqi

🎓 Final Year Computer Science Student @ FAST NUCES Karachi  
🧠 Passionate about Machine Learning, Deep Learning & Computer Vision  
💼 Currently leading research on an AI-based Diabetic Patient Management (ADPM) System  

🔬 Research & Projects:
• Developed an **Image-Based Recommender System** for **Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU)** treatment using:
   - **ConvNeXt**, **Swin Transformer**, **Vision Transformer (ViT)**, and 6+ CNN architectures  
   - Hybrid approach: Deep learning for wound classification + **XGBoost** for treatment recommendation  
• Implemented **YOLOv11** for real-time instance segmentation in medical images  
• Built **full-stack web and mobile app** tools for image annotation and diabetic ulcer analysis using **FastAPI**, TensorFlow.js, and **REST APIs**. The system generated downloadable **PDF reports** including **segmented overlays**, **treatment recommendations**, and **personalised care plans**.

🧰 Tech Stack:
Languages: Python (FastAPI), Node.js, C/C++  
Frameworks: PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV, Scikit-learn  
Databases: MySQL, MongoDB, Supabase  
Deep Learning Models: Swin Transformer, ViT, ConvNeXt, YOLOv11, ResNet, Inception, EfficientNet, DenseNet, etc.

🎯 Goals:
• Compete in national & international speed coding competitions  
• Apply ML/DL to real-world healthcare challenges
