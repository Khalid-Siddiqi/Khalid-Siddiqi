# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Khalid-Siddiqi

ðŸŽ“ Final Year Computer Science Student @ **FAST NUCES Karachi**  
ðŸ§  Passionate about **Machine Learning, Deep Learning & Computer Vision**  
ðŸ’¼ Currently **leading research** on an **AI-based Diabetic Patient Management (ADPM) System**  
ðŸŽ¯ Seeking opportunities to participate in national and international **Computer Vision & AI competitions** to apply and hone my skills.

## ðŸ”¬ Research & Projects:
- Developed an **Image-Based Recommender System** for **Diabetic Foot Ulcer (DFU)** treatment using:
   - **ConvNeXt**, **Swin Transformer**, **Vision Transformer (ViT)**, and 6+ CNN architectures  
   - Hybrid approach: Deep learning for wound classification + **XGBoost** for treatment recommendation  
- Implemented **YOLOv11** for real-time instance segmentation in medical images  
- Built **full-stack web and mobile app** tools for image annotation and diabetic ulcer analysis using **FastAPI**, TensorFlow.js, and **REST APIs**. The system generated downloadable **PDF reports** including **segmented overlays**, **treatment recommendations**, and **personalised care plans**.

## ðŸ§° Tech Stack:
- **Languages:** Python (FastAPI), Node.js, C/C++  
- **Frameworks:** PyTorch, TensorFlow, OpenCV, Scikit-learn  
- **Databases:** MySQL, MongoDB, Supabase  
- **Deep Learning Models:** Swin Transformer, ViT, ConvNeXt, YOLOv11, ResNet, Inception, EfficientNet, DenseNet, etc.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goals:
- Compete in national & international speed coding and AI/Computer Vision competitions  
- Apply ML/DL to real-world healthcare challenges
